   Significant Topic, No Significance Testing

  <p style="color:seagreen">
   This exploratory research described some statistics on the relationship certain demographics have with different forms of wage theft in the ten most populous states.
  </p>
  <p style="color:seagreen">
   <strong>Was the gathering of this data ethical?</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="color:seagreen">
   The researchers did not gather information from any public source. Rather, they used direct interviews with “front-line workers” in three cities. While they claim their research covers the 10 most populous states, they do not state anywhere explicitly that they conducted their interviews in at least seven of the states, as the only explicit reference to their data collection method stated “three”. They do state that their method resembled the 2014 ERG for identifying workers possibly under the threshold of minimum wage compliance, but this is not expanded upon. Without clarification on how exactly they obtained information for the remaining, undescribed states, we can only judge whether their interview technique in the three metropolitan areas was ethical. In this case, there’s no evidence for the interviews being coerced or manipulated, although limiting the collected data to only front-line workers (but still including information on other professions, like education and health workers) seems limiting. The manner of gathering this data is ambiguous, and the least ethical thing about it is not being more explicit and clear in how they gathered their data in their official report.

   <strong>Are there ethical and unethical uses of this data?</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="color:seagreen">
   An ethical use of this data would be something that appropriately extrapolates the implications in the paper to a relevant conclusion - it would need to be within the scope of this paper. An unethical use would be to use the data to either a) conclude something that would be pure speculation and not directly take to the statistical meaning of the information, or b) use the data (regardless of statistical importance) to worsen conditions for workers. While this is mostly personal opinion, research should rarely be used to justify cruel actions, so it would be unethical to spin any outcome to warrant cut wages.
  </p>
  <p style="color:seagreen">
   <strong>How can we conclude if data is being used ethically?</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="color:seagreen">
   I don’t believe this paper includes clear information from which we could draw any firm conclusions. The authors mostly speak in terms of descriptive statistics, such as the average wage of certain workers in a state. While these numbers (assuming they are honest and accurate) are informative with a broad lens, there are no significance tests in this research that could provide evidence that any difference between these states is significant, that that amount lost for low-wage workers is significantly higher than that which is lost for salaried workers, etc. For example, the researchers have a heading for gender to specifically mention that women are “more likely” to experience wage violations. As far as the data presented to the readers, this is only coming from a simple majority (above 50%) statistic, rather than any significance test proving that the difference could statistically be attributed to the underlying factor of gender, rather than noise in the data collected. This kind of faulty data presentation is latent throughout the work. So while this data provides some interesting numbers to look at, it doesn’t say nearly anything meaningfully.

   <strong>What responsibilities do data scientists have to society?</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="color:seagreen">
   Data scientists should be able to collect data under academically acceptable methods, use appropriate methods of data analysis (including significance testing where needed), and visualize their data in non-misleading, effective matters. Furthermore, the intent of the research should be earnest and honest. Now, there is an important distinction here: data scientists are not inherently researchers. Data scientists are not necessarily collecting data via conducted research nor do they necessarily understand statistics. However, our Data Science program does require an understanding of statistical analysis, and the authors of this article (whether or not they consider themselves data scientists) should have known how to conduct and analyze research. More accurately, data scientists need to prioritize their ability to organize data into a way that can be analyzed and visualize the analyses, whether they are descriptive or inferential. When we’re taught of scientific literacy in schools, common examples of things to be careful of are misleading graphics that skew the presentation of data to make the author’s goals come across, regardless of the truth. That would be against a data scientist’s responsibility to society.
