    The two readings described the (somewhat) recent decision by the Department of Justice (from a Department of Human and Urban Development lawsuit) to require Meta on its Facebook platforms that deliver housing advertisements to terminate their algorithms. The DOJ came from the standpoint that the algorithms relied upon classification of a person that are protected under the FHA, like zip code, race, familial status and disability. They even go as far as to say that Meta “encouraged” housing discrimination. Now, some of the classifiers offered to advertisers on this platform seem to be somewhat broad or nonspecific to actual housing factors, like “interested in Hispanic culture” or “non-Christian”. In the end, this decision boils down to whether trained algorithms can be discriminatory. The DOJ came to the conclusion that they were. <strong>However, it is of my opinion that if this counts as discrimination, so too does all personalized job boards or targeted college recommendations.</strong>
