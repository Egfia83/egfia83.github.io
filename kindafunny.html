   This video examined the changes made <strong>(and the changes needing to be made)</strong> in the video game industry in regard to Black representation, particularly with hair texture and style options. While this video was on an intersection of topics with which I’m not familiar, the essay was well-structured and pointed to a number of recent, illustrative examples. Compared to many video essays of a similar nature, this essayist successfully made a fair assessment of not only the failures of the current development industry but also the strides that have been taken so far.

    One of the tenants of the video points to a comparison between games that provide surface level representation and those that actually strive to invent new mechanics that fix the problems. He compared <i>Elden Ring</i> to <i>Nioh 2</i>, released in 2022 and 2020 respectively. Although <i>Nioh 2</i> was able to develop hair for their Black characters that were varied in style while still being fashionable, <i>Elden Ring</i> (a more recent game) failed to provide a hairstyle that resembled natural Black hair. More than style, the issue seems to be partially in the lack of work on developing accurate textures from which to make the styles, as some games (like <i>Horizon</i>) can design good styles but still craft them from white texture designs.

    This all culminates in an interesting point about how to discuss this matter. While I don’t have any authority on this point, I agreed with the essayist’s perspective: critique of the current state of development should continue to happen but with a tone respectful of the effort developers have put into their games. The essayist was of the opinion that a large amount of the problems could be remedied by having diverse developers work on the game from the start, able to provide their opinion before development begins, rather than needing them to give feedback on “half-baked” ideas.

    This video essay reminded me of discourse in writing communities, which has an inherently different structure to its creation, with novels primarily being written by a single person, not a development team. However, there’s still a precedent of often having Sensitivity Readers, especially if the narrative focuses on identities that are not of the author. 
    <a href: "https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkg7kn/sensitivity-reader-profession-explained-roald-dahl-edits" Sensitivity Readers </a> are not a solution to having more diverse authors in the publication space (similar to how having more diverse developers in the gaming space is also an important expansion), <strong> BUT </strong> they do help authors gain perspective and create diverse <strong> AND</strong> accurate characters.

    A point I agree with is, although not highlighted in great detail in the video, was the idea of diverse representation meaning creating well-rounded characters of varying qualities - i.e. having Black heroes and Black villains. I think this comes up a lot with female representation, where the female heroes that are being written by mainstream media (by very possibly well-meaning male writers) are attempting to show positive representation, but shortchange the actual experience by making them dull and uninteresting. I have also heard this complaint about the “token gay friend” trope in some modern media that attempts to be inclusive but clearly failed to include the represented groups in the writing process. These are failings of the creative industry. But as the video fairly points out, critiques should come with the perspective of understanding that the developers (or writers or show runners) were attempting to create diversity in a well-meaning effort (and not assuming that there was any ill-attempt), and communities can vocally address their concerns not with vitriol but with an empathetic yet firm conviction to see better representation.
