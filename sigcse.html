   How This Extrapolates to Job Searches

   In <a href="https://medium.com/@nickiwashington/when-are-we-gonna-have-a-serious-conversation-about-how-unserious-and-problematic-sigcse-is-839c4f28cc1b"> this blog post</a>, Dr. Nicki Washington discusses the rejection of a proposed panel at a SIGCSE - Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education. This wasn’t an organization with which I was familiar prior to this article, but according to <a href="https://sigcse.org/about/profile.html"> their website</a>, the organization’s goal is to <i>“provide a global forum for educators to discuss research and practice related to… [the] evaluation of computing programs, curricula, and courses at all education levels, as well as broad participation…”</i>. The blog post aims to highlight how the rejection not only is a result of insensitivity and lack of judgment but also the incongruence with the organization’s own mission statement. My response to this blog post is rather limited because I a) have never submitted to a symposium and don’t know what most panel reviews are like on a good day, and b) am not a racial minority and don’t have experiences with distinguishing with a 3rd-person lens whether events are microaggressions/stemming from underlying racism/elitism/etc. or well-intentioned and accurate critiques of quality and best fit. Therefore, my perspective can only come from what I imagine the proper panel review process should be and my experience as a woman in review systems.

   Of all the concerns Dr. Washington raised in her post, I think the most objectively and blatantly careless critique is that of the hypocrisies with the instructions for the 2-page panel proposal. If citations are not required, then they should not be negatively impacted by lacking citations. If they believe technical depth is not needed for this topic, they should not be negatively impacted by lacking full-time tenure-track faculty as panelists. Some of the concerns remind of times when less experienced (but likely more confident) male interviewees got positions or better grades at competitions compared to myself. There does seem to be a mixed opinion on whether women can have fake confidence in themselves (like men are) while not seeming arrogant, or whether they need to humble themselves to be polite and risk never getting jobs they could do. I imagine this experience is compounded for Black women, as Dr. Washington describes in this blog post as well as in other posts she has written on being a woman of color in academic settings.

   Although this strays from the exact setting of the blog post, I do think this maps well onto job descriptions and hiring processes which we discussed earlier this semester. The presence of certain job descriptions in hiring posts is often irrelevant when considering the actual job requirements/duties when someone is in the position. When Dr. Washington was speaking of the expectations of technical depth by the reviewer and how this was viewed as meaning they needed to be a full-time tenure-track professor,I thought of how many jobs view relevant experience and background in a topic meaning they must hold a Master’s in a topic - even for positions like “intern”. These sorts of shortsighted ways of viewing experience limits the number of people able to get positions, which are often the ways that relevant experience is accrued to begin with. <strong>There should be a better standardized and unbiased way to recruit individuals, whether that be for panels or jobs. </strong>
